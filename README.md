# Group 5 - Project 1

An interactive website that represents our three team members through personalized buttons, colors, sounds, and stickers.

## Overview

This project uses interactive buttons to showcase each team member's personality through three mediums:

- **Colors**: Each person has a unique color palette that reflects their personality
- **Sound**: Clicking each button plays a distinct audio layer; when all three buttons are active, they combine to create a full musical composition
- **Stickers**: Personal stickers representing each member's interests and identity

## The Three Personalities

- **Crystal** (Blossom) - Pink color palette with triangle beeps
- **Delaram** (Bubble) - Blue color palette with sine wave melodies  
- **Abi** (Sunflower) - Yellow/gold color palette with rhythmic kick and hat sounds

## How It Works

The buttons at the bottom of the navbar represent each of us. Interact with them to learn about us through colours, sound, and stickers! PS: Make sure your volume is on!

The paintings represent our team dynamics. Try to get to the final result using the colours and stickers!

## How To Run It
